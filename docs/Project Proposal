Project Proposal: AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Equipment Executive Summary
This capstone project proposes the development of an AI-powered predictive maintenance system (PdM) for industrial equipment, utilizing machine learning to forecast failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and minimize operational costs. The system integrates real-time IoT sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure) with historical maintenance logs, utilizing Random Forests for failure classiﬁcation and LSTM neural networks for time-series forecasting. A Streamlit dashboard will provide real-time visualizations and decision support. The project, spanning 12 weeks, aims to achieve >85% prediction accuracy, reduce downtime by 40%, and save 25% in maintenance costs, as validated on a public dataset (NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation). Deliverables include a GitHub-hosted prototype, comprehensive documentation, and a presentation showcasing alignment with data science and software engineering coursework. Ethical AI practices, scalability, and robust risk mitigation ensure a production-ready solution.
Introduction and Background
Unplanned equipment failures in industries like manufacturing and energy cause signiﬁcant losses, with downtime costing up to $50 billion annually across sectors (McKinsey, 2023). Traditional maintenance (reactive or scheduled) is ineﬃcient, leading to 20-30% over-maintenance or unexpected breakdowns. This project addresses these challenges by developing an AI-driven PdM system that predicts failures using sensor data, reducing downtime and extending equipment lifespan. It applies machine learning, data processing, and UI development skills from the major, targeting equipment like turbines and pumps.
Competitive Landscape
There are predictive maintenance solutions available in the market (e.g. IBM Maximo, GE Predix), but most of them are costly, need proprietary infrastructure, or the AI model is non-transparent. The solution is diﬀerentiated by an open-source basis, explainability (using SHAP), and cost-eﬀective provisions when it comes to small to mid-size businesses.

•	Produce a scalable prototype with modular code, documented in a GitHub repository.
•	Deliver a portfolio presentation demonstrating technical proﬁciency and industry relevance.
•	Ensure ethical AI deployment with transparency, fairness, and minimal environmental impact.

Ethical Considerations
•	Data Privacy: Use anonymized public datasets; simulate GDPR compliance by masking any hypothetical identiﬁers.
•	Fairness: Audit for bias using aif360 (e.g., disparate impact ratio >0.8); ensure predictions are equitable across equipment types.
•	Transparency: SHAP plots and model summaries provided to users, explaining predictions in human-readable terms (e.g., “Vibration spike caused 90% failure probability”).
•	Environmental Impact: Optimize maintenance to reduce energy waste (e.g., 10% less power for over-maintained equipment, per simulation).
•	Workforce Impact: Include recommendations for technician retraining in documentation, mitigating automation-related job concerns.
•	Compliance: Adhere to IEEE Ethically Aligned Design principles; obtain mock stakeholder approval for deployment.
•	Industry Impact: The suggested system can transform predictive maintenance in various industries, including aviation, manufacturing and renewable energy. It can save billions of dollars of losses each year to global economies by reducing unexpected downtime, and improve safety and make industrial operations greener and more sustainable.
•	Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement: Close collaboration with the professionals working in the industry, academic consultants, and potential users will also play a major part in the success of this project. The reﬁnements will be informed by the stakeholder workshops and feedbacks to ensure that the solution is compatible with the real world requirements in addition to maximizing the adoption potential.
•	Sustainability Considerations: The system helps minimize industrial waste and carbon emission by reducing the need to replace parts that do not need replacement and premature maintenance. It is estimated, using simulations, that optimized maintenance would reduce the equipment-related waste by as much as 15 percent each year in line with the world sustainability objectives.
Future Enhancements
The system may be modiﬁed to include predictive reinforcement learning in future versions to enable the system to adjust maintenance schedules in response to real-time feedback. The simulated test environments can be oﬀered through the integration with the digital twins and improve the accuracy of the failure detection. Also, blockchain has the potential of being investigated in secure maintenance data logging to guarantee audit trails that are not tampered with.
 
Conclusion
This AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System is a technically rigorous and ethically sound capstone project that addresses a critical industry need. By achieving precise failure predictions, scalable deployment, and transparent operations, it maximizes impact while aligning with coursework in machine learning, data processing, and UI development. The detailed timeline, robust metrics, and proactive risk mitigation ensure a well-thought-out proposal, poised for extension into industry applications.
