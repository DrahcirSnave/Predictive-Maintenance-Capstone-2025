# ❓ Project Q&A Session

**Q1: Why did you choose a Random Forest and LSTM hybrid approach?**
**A:** We chose **Random Forest** for its interpretability and ability to handle binary classification (Fail/No-Fail) effectively with limited compute resources. We chose **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks for the regression task (predicting exact RUL) because LSTMs are specifically designed to recognize patterns in time-series data, making them ideal for analyzing sensor degradation over time.

**Q2: How do you handle the "Class Imbalance" in failure data?**
**A:** In predictive maintenance, "healthy" data vastly outweighs "failure" data. We addressed this during the **Data Preprocessing** phase by creating a rolling window of failure labels (e.g., labeling data points within 30 cycles of failure as "1"). This increases the number of positive samples, allowing the model to learn failure patterns more effectively.

**Q3: What is the business impact of this model?**
**A:** Our analysis indicates a potential **40% reduction in downtime** and **25% savings in maintenance costs**. By predicting failures before they occur, companies can switch from reactive maintenance (fixing broken machines) to predictive maintenance (fixing them right before they break).

**Q4: How scalable is this solution?**
**A:** The system was built using scalable libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. It runs efficiently on enhanced GPUs and can be deployed via Docker containers or cloud platforms (like Google Colab or AWS) to handle data from thousands of sensors simultaneously.
